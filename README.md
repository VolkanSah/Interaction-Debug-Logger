## Description

**Enhanced Interaction & Debug Logger Pro** is a professional WordPress debugging plugin that captures everything - from simple page requests to fatal PHP errors. Born from frustration with bloated monitoring tools and debug bars that slow down development, this plugin provides a lightweight, comprehensive logging solution.

**Why this plugin exists:** After dealing with overloaded debug bars, heavy monitoring apps, and tools that miss critical errors (especially fatal errors during plugin installations), I decided to enhance my original logging tool with the help of Claude 4 Sonnet to create something that actually works when you need it most.

## Key Features

### 🔥 **Fatal Error Detection**
- **Catches PHP Fatal Errors** that crash your site during plugin testing
- **Shutdown Function Handler** captures errors that other tools miss
- **Plugin Installation Crashes** are now logged and traceable

### 🚀 **Professional Logging**
- **Real-time WordPress Debug Integration** - automatically enables WP_DEBUG when needed
- **Combined Log Views** - see your custom logs AND WordPress debug-log.txt in one place
- **Copy-to-Clipboard Functionality** - finally works properly with modern browsers
- **Color-coded Error Levels** - Fatal errors in red, warnings in orange, notices in yellow

### 🎯 **Smart Console**
- **Expandable Console** appears on both frontend and admin
- **Auto-refresh with pause/resume** controls
- **Tab-based Interface** for different log types
- **Auto-scroll to latest entries** option

### ⚡ **Performance Optimized**
- **File-locking** prevents corruption during concurrent requests
- **Configurable log size limits** prevent disk space issues
- **Optional AJAX request filtering** keeps logs clean
- **Lightweight footprint** - no bloat, just functionality

### 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n) Ready**
- **Full WP-i18n integration** ensures all text strings are translatable.
- **`.pot` and `.po` file generation support** to easily create new language packs.
- **Seamless multi-language compatibility** for a global developer community.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and unzip it.
2. Upload the `enhanced-interaction-debug-logger` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Go to `Tools > Debug Logger Pro` to configure the settings.

## Usage

### Basic Setup
- **Enable Logging:** Navigate to `Tools > Debug Logger Pro` and enable logging
- **WordPress Debug Mode:** Enable automatic WordPress debugging integration
- **Configure Refresh Rate:** Set how often logs update (default: 1 second)

### Viewing Logs
- **Live Logs Tab:** Your custom interaction and error logs
- **WordPress Debug Tab:** Standard WordPress debug-log.txt content
- **Combined View:** Everything in chronological order with auto-scroll

### Console Usage
- **Frontend/Admin Console:** Fixed console at bottom of screen
- **Click to expand/collapse:** Doesn't interfere with normal usage
- **Copy logs instantly** with the copy button
- **Clear logs** when needed

### Error Detection
The plugin automatically catches and logs:
- Fatal PHP Errors
- Parse Errors
- Plugin/Theme Errors
- Database Errors
- Custom Error Messages
- All WordPress Debug Messages

### WP_DEBUG Integration
For most interactions during plugin and theme development, this tool is enought. If you need a complete debug history including all WordPress notices and warnings with this plugin, you must manually enable it. Add the following lines to your `wp-config.php`:

```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
```
Many developers already have these lines enabled. The plugin will use the debug-log.txt file created by WordPress for its "WordPress Debug" tab.
